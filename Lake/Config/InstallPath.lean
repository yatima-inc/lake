Try to find the home of the given `lean` command (if it exists)
by calling `lean --print-prefix` and returning the path it prints.
Defaults to trying the `lean` in `PATH`.

Try to find the installation of the given `lean` command
by calling `findLeanCmdHome?`.

It assumes that the Lean installation is setup the normal way.
That is, with its binaries located in `<lean-home>/bin` and its
libraries and `.olean` files located in `<lean-home>/lib/lean`.

Check if Lake's executable is co-located with Lean, and, if so,
try to return their joint home by assuming they are both located at `<home>/bin`.

Try to find Lean's installation by
first checking the `LEAN_SYSROOT` environment variable
and then by trying `findLeanCmdHome?`.

It assumes that the Lean installation is setup the normal way.
That is, with its binaries located in `<lean-home>/bin` and its
libraries and `.olean` files located in `<lean-home>/lib/lean`.

Try to find Lake's installation by
first checking the `LAKE_HOME` environment variable
and then by trying the `lakeBuildHome?` of the running executable.

It assumes that the Lake installation is setup the same way it is built.
That is, with its binary located at `<lake-home>/bin/lake` and its static
library and `.olean` files in `<lake-home>/lib`.
-/
def findLakeInstall? : IO (Option LakeInstall) := do

/--
Try to get Lake's install path by first trying `findLakeLeanHome?`
then by running `findLeanInstall?` and `findLakeInstall?`.

If Lake is co-located with `lean` (i.e., there is `lean` executable
in the same directory as itself), it will assume it was installed with
Lean and their binaries are located in `<lean-home>/bin` with
Lean's libraries and `.olean` files at `<lean-home>/lib/lean` and
Lake's static library and `.olean` files at `<lean-home>/lib/lean`.

  if let some home ← findLakeLeanJointHome? then
    return (some {home}, some {home, libDir := home / "lib" / "lean"})
